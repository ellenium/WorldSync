     * A GUI similar to the one that Grappl spawns when it first opens, but with some
     * relevant differences.
     *
     * There is only a login prompt.
     *  - A username field
     *  - A password field
     *  - A login button
     *  - A signup button, that opens a link to the website
     *
     *  And then that's literally it until the user logs in, after which point another GUI will
     *  be spawned, containing the primary options.
     *
     *  A list of relevant details will be downloaded in a json format file, containing
     *  account data such as the servers associated with the account.
     *
